# Bank-Marketing
<br>
This is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives you information about a marketing campaign of a financial institution in which you will have to analyze in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.

# Context
Find the best strategies to improve for the next marketing campaign. How can the financial institution have a greater effectiveness for future marketing campaigns? In order to answer this, we have to analyze the last marketing campaign the bank performed and identify the patterns that will help us find conclusions in order to develop future strategies.
